## We have some stuff to think about

- [ ]  make ruby strong typed using Sorbet - https://sorbet.org
- [ ] develop the rest of the synthax - We could copy sourcery synthax, not entirely, though - https://cdn.rawgit.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/master/docs/Classes/Type.html
- [ ] we need someone studying how to write ruby code beatifully
- [ ] can we easily integrate ruby with another language that is quicker to understand? Do we really need to do that?
- [ ] Unit tests
